# Saba: Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Platform for Amharic

**Saba** is an open-source project focused on building a natural voice assistant that understands and speaks **Amharic**. Inspired by platforms like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, Saba aims to bridge the gap in voice technology for underrepresented languages—starting with Amharic.

---

## 🌍 Vision

Our goal is to create an intuitive, AI-powered voice interface in Amharic, enabling users to interact with technology using their native language through speech recognition and synthesis.

---

## 🔧 Features

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts spoken Amharic into written text using ASR models such as Whisper and wav2vec2.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts Amharic text into natural-sounding speech using TTS engines like Coqui and ESPnet.
- **Language-first**: Designed specifically with a focus on the Amharic language and cultural context.
- **Modular Design**: Built for future expansion into skills such as calendar integration, reminders, or smart home control.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **STT Engines**: OpenAI Whisper, Facebook wav2vec2
- **TTS Engines**: Coqui TTS, ESPnet
- **Libraries & Tools**:
  - PyTorch
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - Gradio (for demo UI)
  - Flask or FastAPI (for APIs)

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- ✅ Speech-to-text pipeline in Amharic *(in progress)*
- ✅ Text-to-speech generation in Amharic *(in progress)*
- ⏳ Real-time voice interface *(planned)*
- ⏳ Skill integration (weather, Q&A, basic commands) *(planned)*
- ⏳ Wake-word detection and conversational flow *(planned)*
